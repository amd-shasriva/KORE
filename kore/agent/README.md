# `kore/agent` — the multi-turn tool-use harness

`AgentHarness` drives a Hermes-style tool-use loop over `KoreEnv`: the model calls `build` / `test` / `bench` / `pmc` / `keep` / `revert` across multiple turns, receiving verifier feedback each turn. It powers both agentic datagen ([`kore/data/gen_agentic.py`](../data/README.md)) and the agentic GRPO rollout ([`kore/policy/grpo.py`](../policy/README.md)). Orchestration is CPU-only; all GPU work is injected through `env`.

The same message contract (`format.py`) is reused **without a GPU** by [`kore/data/synth_agentic.py`](../data/README.md), which reconstructs agentic SFT trajectories from already-verified `repair` / `wins` / `groups` records. `build_agent_system_prompt(..., arch=)` parameterizes the target descriptor (`gfx950` → "AMD Instinct MI350X (gfx950 / CDNA4)", `gfx942` → "AMD Instinct MI300X (gfx942 / CDNA3)"); `arch=None` falls back to the KORE target default (gfx950 / CDNA4), so an un-arched caller trains the policy on the current target rather than a previous-gen board.

## The turn loop

```mermaid

  participant M as Model/Teacher
  participant H as AgentHarness
  participant E as ToolExecutor
  participant V as KoreEnv (GPU)
  H->>M: messages (system + task + KB few-shots)
  M->>H: assistant text
  H->>H: parse_reflection + parse_tool_calls
  loop each tool call
    H->>E: dispatch(build/test/bench/pmc/keep/revert)
    E->>V: env.step
    V-->>E: Observation + reward
    E-->>H: JSON result (appended as role:tool)
  end
  H->>H: record turn_rewards / turn_correct (Kevin credit)
  alt stalled reseed_patience turns
    H->>E: reseed_lineage (preserves best_src)
  end
  H-->>H: AgentEpisode
```

Key behaviors:

- **Kevin credit contract.** `ToolExecutor` tracks `best_src` — the trajectory is scored by the *best correct* kernel seen, not the last turn. `turn_rewards` / `turn_correct` are recorded per turn **without rounding** (bit-exact for GRPO advantage estimation).
- **Phase switch.** The episode starts in a correctness phase; on the first correct kernel the system prompt swaps to an optimization phase.
- **Reseed escape.** After `reseed_patience` (3) non-improving turns the harness reseeds the lineage but preserves `best_src`, so a reset can never erase verified progress.
- **Wins knowledge base.** `WinsKB` retrieves prior `WinRecord`s by `(family, dtype)` for few-shot injection, same-family only (no cross-op leak).
- **Reward mode.** `ToolExecutor` honors `KORE_REWARD_MODE` (default `speedup`; `residual` for the physics reward), so agentic rollouts use the same reward as the rest of the system.

Tool-use shaping (`tool_use_reward`) rewards correct schemas, keep/revert discipline, and grounded reflection, folded into the best correct turn — but always dominated by the verified kernel outcome.

## Verified-transform tools

Beyond the base six, the harness can advertise the **ε-typed transformation calculus** as first-class tools, so the policy proposes **in-contract** optimization moves instead of free-form edits. This is opt-in and enabled in the flagship configuration (`agentic_transform_tools: true` → `_rollout_agentic` builds the harness via `agent_tool_schemas(transforms=True)`); it is off by default, so agentic datagen / SFT reconstruction stay byte-identical to the base set.

| Tool | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `list_transforms` | The transforms currently **legal** for the working kernel under its remaining ε-budget (each typed `exact`/`approx` with an ε cost + side conditions) |
| `apply_transform` | Apply ONE named transform (+ params) with ε-accounting; returns the rewritten source. An inadmissible / budget-exceeding move is **rejected** and the source is left unchanged (never out-of-contract) |

- **Bounded, shared budget.** `ToolExecutor` lazily builds a per-episode `ErrorBudget` sized from the task's `(operation, dtype)` ([`kore/transform`](../transform/README.md)); approx moves draw it down across turns (exact moves are free), and it is **reset on reseed**, so the agent sees a *shrinking* set of safe moves as it spends numerical tolerance.
- **The env is the authority.** These tools are pure-CPU source rewrites — the model must still `build`/`test`/`bench` the result through the verified env, so an approx move that actually drifts is caught by the **SNR gate**. The `exact`/`approx` typing is a design-time action-space label, not a proof of equivalence; the guarantee is downstream numerical verification, not the type. See [`kore/transform`](../transform/README.md).
- **Anti-reward-hack spine.** Because the action space is bounded to in-contract rewrites, a policy composing only these moves structurally *cannot* emit a memset / cache / timing exploit — the same calculus AlphaKernel searches over ([`kore/search`](../search/README.md)).

## Per-turn physics trace and latency feedback

The harness records four **index-aligned** per-turn arrays on `AgentEpisode` (one entry per turn, in lockstep with `turn_rewards` / `turn_correct`), so the agentic rollout feeds GRPO the same per-turn signals as the serial path:

| `AgentEpisode` field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `turn_speedups` | per-turn MEASURED vendor speedup (only when the turn benched a correct kernel, else `None`) |
| `turn_phis` | per-turn roofline **potential** `Φ` for PBS — online the PMC-free `η`; `ρ` only when counters are threaded; `None` unless benched + correct |
| `turn_codes` | per-turn candidate kernel source |

These are populated in `_record_turn` from matching `ToolExecutor` state set in `_evaluate`:

- **`ToolExecutor.candidate_speedup`** — the benched-correct candidate's measured worst-shape speedup. A `build` / `test` turn leaves it `None`, so a non-timed turn never fabricates a speedup.
- **`ToolExecutor.candidate_phi`** — an evidence-gated potential for that turn. It is `None` unless a fingerprint-pinned P0 artifact passes for the task family under the exact runtime model. The current controlled P0 result has no passing family, so the flagship shaping weight is zero and this field remains a boundary; see [`docs/P0_RESULTS.md`](../../docs/P0_RESULTS.md).
- **`ToolExecutor.best_speedup`** — the measured-speedup **frontier** (max over benched-correct candidates), tracked *independently* of `best_reward` (still the Kevin scoring key), so the `bench` tool can report an honest frontier delta.

On the GRPO side, `grpo._agentic_per_turn_signal` recovers these arrays correctness-gated and index-aligned (degrading to `("", None, None)` per turn): `turn_phis → traj_phis → build_kevin_samples(phi_weight=…)` densifies per-turn credit via PBS, while `turn_codes` / `turn_speedups` feed co-evolution distillation and the open-ended controller — reaching parity with the serial `_rollout`.

**Bench-tool frontier delta.** The `bench` tool result carries per-turn latency feedback so the model can see whether *this* change actually helped:

| `bench` result field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `best_speedup_so_far` | running best measured speedup this episode |
| `delta_vs_best` | signed `cur − prev_best` (the frontier is snapshotted *before* this candidate is folded in) |
| `improved_frontier` | whether this turn pushed the frontier |

This is **pure context** — the trained reward is still the verified `compute_kernel_reward`, so surfacing the delta to the policy cannot be gamed.
